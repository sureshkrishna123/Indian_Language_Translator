# Indian_language_translator

Using Streamlit, I made this web application.

Streamlit helps us to built web application using just python code. Here is the link for Streamlit - https://streamlit.io/

Here translator.py file is the code used for web aplication.

If you want the code for the transaltion using audio file, available in  language_translator_audio.py.

This code works for eveny language. You have to provide the audio file and audio language code (which is availabe here - https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).

Using google speech recognition, it will give speech to text and after using gooogletrans, convert the text to english.

Note: No need google cloud subscription. Free to use.

2. Text to Speech language translation

For example, if you given the text my name is suresh, first using googletrans it will convert the desired language you want

After using gTTS, It will convert to speech and display audio and translated text.
